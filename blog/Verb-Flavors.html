            <p>Are all verbs created equally?</p>

            <p>
              Verbs do a lot of heavy lifting in English. They tell us what is
              happening, what is changing,
            </p>
            <p>
              and sometimes what is not changing at all. Without verbs,
              sentences would just sit there
            </p>
            <p>
              like unlabeled boxes. Grammatically correct, perhaps, but not
              terribly useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tricky part is that not all verbs behave the same way. Some
              are energetic and active.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some are calm and stationary. Some just quietly connect ideas
              without doing much themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding these differences makes English suddenly feel less
              arbitrary and far more logical.
            </p>
            <p>Think of verbs as having flavors.</p>
            <p>Action Verbs: The Ones That Get Things Done</p>
            <p>
              Action verbs are exactly what they sound like. They describe
              actions. Things happening in the real world or in the mind.
            </p>
            <p>She runs every morning.</p>
            <p>They built a house.</p>
            <p>He forgot her name.</p>
            <p>We discussed the problem.</p>
            <p>
              Some of these actions are visible. Running, building, opening.
              Others happen internally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinking, deciding, remembering. Both count. If something is
              happening, even quietly,
            </p>
            <p>you are probably dealing with an action verb.</p>
            <p>Action verbs are also very comfortable in continuous tenses.</p>
            <p>She is running late.</p>
            <p>We were discussing the issue.</p>
            <p>I am thinking about your idea.</p>
            <p>
              If a verb sounds natural with “is” or “are” plus “-ing,” it is
              almost certainly an action verb.
            </p>
            <p>So far, so straightforward.</p>
            <p>Stative Verbs: The Ones That Prefer to Sit Still</p>
            <p>
              Stative verbs describe states, not actions. They tell us how
              things are, not what they are doing.
            </p>
            <p>These often relate to:</p>
            <p>thoughts and beliefs: know, believe, understand</p>
            <p>emotions: love, hate, prefer</p>
            <p>possession: have, own, belong</p>
            <p>senses: see, hear, smell</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <p>I know the answer.</p>
            <p>She loves her job.</p>
            <p>We own this house.</p>
            <p>He believes the story.</p>
            <p>
              Here is the key idea. Stative verbs usually do not like continuous
              forms.
            </p>
            <p>These sentences sound wrong to most native speakers:</p>
            <p>I am knowing the answer.</p>
            <p>She is loving her job.</p>
            <p>We are owning this house.</p>
            <p>
              Why? Because these verbs describe conditions that are already
              true. You do not actively
            </p>
            <p>
              “do” knowing or owning in the same way you do running or building.
              They simply exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where many learners get frustrated, because English
              immediately complicates things.
            </p>
            <p>When Verbs Change Their Mind</p>
            <p>
              Some verbs can be action verbs or stative verbs depending on how
              they are used. Context decides.
            </p>
            <p>Compare:</p>
            <p>I think you are right.</p>
            <p>I am thinking about your suggestion.</p>
            <p>
              In the first sentence, think describes a belief. That is stative.
              In the second, it describes
            </p>
            <p>a mental process. That is an action.</p>
            <p>Another classic pair:</p>
            <p>The soup tastes good.</p>
            <p>She is tasting the soup.</p>
            <p>Same verb. Different flavor.</p>
            <p>
              English does this a lot. It bends its own patterns for nuance and
              expression. Once you understand
            </p>
            <p>
              the difference between action and state, these shifts start to
              make sense instead of feeling random.
            </p>
            <p>Linking Verbs: The Quiet Middlemen</p>
            <p>
              Linking verbs do not describe action or state in the usual way.
              Their job is to connect the
            </p>
            <p>subject to information about the subject.</p>
            <p>The most common linking verb is be:</p>
            <p>She is tired.</p>
            <p>The sky was gray.</p>
            <p>Others include:</p>
            <p>seem</p>
            <p>appear</p>
            <p>become</p>
            <p>feel</p>
            <p>look</p>
            <p>sound</p>
            <p>taste</p>
            <p>smell</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <p>He seems confident.</p>
            <p>The plan became complicated.</p>
            <p>The music sounds beautiful.</p>
            <p>
              A helpful test is this. If the verb is followed by an adjective or
              a noun that describes the
            </p>
            <p>subject, you are probably looking at a linking verb.</p>
            <p>Compare:</p>
            <p>She looks happy.</p>
            <p>She looks at the painting.</p>
            <p>
              In the first sentence, looks links the subject to a description.
              In the second, it describes
            </p>
            <p>an action. Same word. Different job.</p>
            <p>So Did McDonald’s Make a Grammar Mistake?</p>
            <p>
              This brings us to one of the most famous verb questions in modern
              English.
            </p>
            <p>“I’m lovin’ it.”</p>
            <p>
              Technically speaking, love is a stative verb. By the traditional
              rule, it should not appear
            </p>
            <p>in the continuous form. So did McDonald’s get it wrong?</p>
            <p>Not really.</p>
            <p>
              In this case, love is being treated as a temporary, emotional
              experience, not a permanent state.
            </p>
            <p>
              The slogan is not saying “I love this forever as a deep emotional
              truth.” It is saying “I am enjoying this right now.”
            </p>
            <p>Native speakers do this all the time:</p>
            <p>I’m loving this weather.</p>
            <p>She’s really loving her new job.</p>
            <p>Is it formal? No. Is it natural? Very much so.</p>
            <p>
              This is a perfect example of why understanding grammar matters
              more than memorizing rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              McDonald’s was not ignorant of the rule. They were bending it
              deliberately for tone, immediacy, and voice.
            </p>
            <p>That is not bad grammar. That is expressive grammar.</p>
            <p>Why This Matters More Than You Think</p>
            <p>Recognizing verb types helps with:</p>
            <p>correct tense choice</p>
            <p>natural phrasing</p>
            <p>exam accuracy</p>
            <p>
              understanding why something sounds wrong, not just that it does
            </p>
            <p>
              When a learner writes “I am knowing him for five years,” the
              problem is not vocabulary.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is verb flavor. Once know is identified as stative, the correct
              form becomes obvious.
            </p>
            <p>I have known him for five years.</p>
            <p>
              Grammar stops feeling like a list of exceptions and starts acting
              like a system.
            </p>
            <p>Final Bite</p>
            <p>Action verbs move.</p>
            <p>Stative verbs rest.</p>
            <p>Linking verbs connect.</p>
            <p>
              Once you see what a verb is trying to do, the sentence usually
              falls into place.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when English breaks its own patterns, it usually does so for a
              reason.
            </p>
            <p>The trick is knowing when a rule is being broken on purpose.</p>
            <p>That is when grammar gets interesting.</p>
            <p>
              If you enjoyed this one, stick around. There are plenty more
              flavors to sample.
