Understanding when to use active or passive voice can significantly improve your writing clarity and impact. Both voices have their place, but knowing the difference will help you choose the best fit for your message.

### What is Active Voice?

Active voice means the subject performs the action.

- _The student_ completed the assignment.
- _She_ wrote a compelling essay.

Active sentences tend to be clearer and more direct.

### What is Passive Voice?

Passive voice means the subject receives the action.

- The assignment _was completed_ by the student.
- The essay _was written_ by her.

Passive voice can be useful when the doer is unknown or unimportant.

### When to Use Each?

Use **active voice** for stronger, more concise sentences. Use **passive voice** when you want to emphasize the action or when the actor isn’t important.

### Quick Tips

- Avoid overusing passive voice; it can make your writing vague.
- Check if your sentence clearly states who is doing what.
- Use passive voice strategically for emphasis or formality.
