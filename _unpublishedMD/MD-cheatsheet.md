Tips

    Wrap lines at about 80 characters for readability in editors.

    Always leave a blank line between elements (like between paragraphs, lists, etc.).

    Keep your assets organized; images should be referenced relative to your Markdown file location.

    Preview your post with Eleventyâ€™s dev server to check formatting live.
