              I‚Äôm Stanley, a certified ESL teacher with over 2,000 classroom hours. I help adults speak English with confidence for work, life, and exams.

              My lessons focus on real communication. We speak from day one, with grammar and writing used to support fluency and clarity.

              I‚Äôve worked with students preparing for:

              IELTS and ICAO aviation assessments 

              Immigration interviews and 

              Careers in tech, software, data, IT, and engineering

              Whether you need to ace an interview, lead a meeting, or simply feel more at ease in English, I can help.

            <p class="section-text">
              I teach speaking first, and use Grammar as a foundation to build confidence.  
              Listening, writing, and vocabulary all support your ability to speak clearly and naturally in real situations. Pairing 
              the four essiential skills with their natural partners, listening with speaking, reading with writing, allows skills to 
              feed each other and drive success. When we first meet I will make an assessment of your skill level, address your goals 
              and interests, and tailor a learning plan suited to you.
