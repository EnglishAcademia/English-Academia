          <h3>Why It Was Built</h3>
          <p>
            English Academia came into being because I wanted a place that was
            truly inviting. A space that moves beyond the usual formulas while
            still respecting solid academic standards. I have tutored
            extensively on those large commercial sites, and while they have
            their advantages, In those settings, both students and tutors can
            sometimes feel like products in a marketplace. This space is meant
            to feel intimate and welcoming, like settling into a cozy fireside
            study with a good book. A quiet corner of the internet where
            curiosity can wander freely and language can be explored on your own
            terms.

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a American English speaker from the southeast United States,
            with a diverse background from landscape management to years as a
            professional chef. My academic background, while attending
            university in Florida, laid a strong foundation for my professional
            approach to language and communication. Technology and creativity
            are close to my heart, and I’m a hobbyist web developer, programmer,
            and graphic designer. After years of travel, I’ve settled in the
            beautiful city of Vlora, Albania, where I live with my spouse, two
            dogs, and a cat. I believe there’s more that unites us than divides
            us, and language is one of those bridges. No matter your skill
            level, real human connection comes through the words we share.

            the routine. For teachers who want to keep growing. For anyone who’s

            to explain it to someone else. Whether you’re a student, a teacher,
            a language geek, or just someone who enjoys the occasional rabbit
            hole of grammar and vocabulary, English Academia was built with you
